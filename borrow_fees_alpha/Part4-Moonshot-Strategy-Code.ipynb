On the other hand, their high borrow fees make them unattractive to short. In the next two notebooks, we pit these competing forces against each other by using Moonshot to backtest a strategy that shorts the top decile of stocks by borrow fee, while also incurring the borrowing costs of those short positions.

    "The `prices_to_signals` method of the Moonshot strategy replicates much of the logic from our Pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Near the end of the `prices_to_signals` method, we use `get_ibkr_borrow_fees_reindexed_like(...)` to pull borrow fees into the strategy. We then use `rank(axis=1...)` to rank stocks daily by borrow fee, then select the top decile.\n",
    "* Before that, we limit the universe to common stocks in the top 75% by dollar volume. This is done by creating two boolean DataFrames (`are_common_stocks` and `have_adequate_dollar_volumes`). These DataFrames are passed to Pandas' `where()` method before ranking (`are_common_stocks` is applied before ranking by dollar volume, and `have_adequate_dollar_volumes` is applied before ranking by borrow fees). This approach of using `where()`, which is typical in Moonshot, sets the dollar volumes or borrow fees, respectively, to `NaN` for stocks that don't belong in the universe and thereby excludes such stocks from the ranking, as `rank(...)` ignores `NaN`s. \n",
